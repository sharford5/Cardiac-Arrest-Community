<!-- Introduction -->
## Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) Survival Modeling with Community Information

Welcome to the repository for our deep learning model focused on predicting outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases. This project leverages cutting-edge techniques in deep learning to contribute to the field of emergency medicine and improve patient care.


### Overview
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a critical medical emergency that requires swift and accurate interventions. This repository hosts a deep learning model designed to predict the likelihood of successful resuscitation and patient survival based on a variety of input features. By harnessing the power of data-driven predictions, we aim to assist medical professionals in making informed decisions during high-stress situations.

This work contributes:
* Evaluation of community level information on the predictability of OHCA survival
* Community socioeconomic information including crime, healthcare, and economic factors from public data were merged with CARES
* Baseline results using CARES data achieved an AUROC of 84% use improved to 88% using community information
